# Todo App: My First Full Stack Application

## Plan

The application will consist of several routes including sign-in, sign-up, about me, main pages, and an AI chat.

- **Sign-in/Sign-up**: These will consist of two pages - sign-in and sign-up. A user authentication and password reset system will be implemented via email.

- **Main**: This will be a basic todo app where users can add, view, remove, and edit tasks.

- **AI Chat**: A separate route for an AI chat page. The AI will be aware of the user's tasks, providing a more interactive experience.

- **About Me**: This page will contain my personal information and contact details.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to enhance the AI bot chat feature. The AI will be able to interact with the user based on their tasks, providing a more personalized and interactive user experience.

The following technologies will be used to build this application:

- **Bun**: A fast, modern all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building JavaScript applications.
