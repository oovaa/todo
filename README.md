# Todo App: My First Full Stack Application

## Plan

The application will consist of several routes including login, about me, and main pages.

- **Login**: This will consist of two pages - login and register. A user authentication and password reset system will be implemented via email.

- **Main**: This will be a basic todo app where users can add, view, remove, and edit tasks. Additionally, a chat page with an AI will be added. The AI will be aware of the user's tasks, providing a more interactive experience.

- **About Me**: This page will contain my personal information and contact details.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to add a dedicated site for the AI bot chat. This AI will be aware of the user's tasks and will be able to interact with the user based on these tasks. This will provide a more personalized and interactive user experience.


## Tech Stack

The following technologies will be used to build this application:

- **Bun**: a fast modren all in one js runtime.

- **Vite**: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building JavaScript applications.
- **FeathersJs**: An open source web framework for building real time applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
