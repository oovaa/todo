# Todo App: My First Full Stack Application

## Plan

The application will consist of several routes including sign-in, sign-up, about me, and main pages.

- **Sign-in/Sign-up**: These will consist of two pages - sign-in and sign-up. A user authentication and password reset system will be implemented via email.

- **Main**: This will be a basic todo app where users can add, view, remove, and edit tasks. Additionally, a chat page with an AI will be added. The AI will be aware of the user's tasks, providing a more interactive experience.

- **About Me**: This page will contain my personal information and contact details.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to add a dedicated site for the AI bot chat. This AI will be aware of the user's tasks and will be able to interact with the user based on these tasks. This will provide a more personalized and interactive user experience.

The following technologies will be used to build this application:

- **Bun**: a fast modern all in one js runtime.

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building JavaScript applications.
- **FeathersJs**: An open source web framework for building real time applications.
- **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
